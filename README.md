# EcoLog---Code-for-Nature-Challenge-2024
This was one of my earliest projects that was made in replit
Through EcoLog's web application, users log their daily activities, and AI classifies them as either carbon emitting or carbon-neutral. Users can refer to their personal dashboard, which displays their actions and cumulative impact. To motivate users to take carbon-neutral actions, they are rewarded for logging them. For every two carbon-neutral activities logged, the user's background is gradually "greenified" (to simulate the positive effects of their actions in the real world), and for every ten carbon-neutral activities users perform, they earn a new background that  they can improve.
